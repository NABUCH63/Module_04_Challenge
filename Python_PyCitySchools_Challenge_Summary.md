# **Python PyCitySchools Analysis**

## Background

The purpose of this analysis was to re-examine the passing scores before and after removing the nineth grade students of Thomas High School. The scores were averaged for each school, and further subdivided into the individual grade performances. The change in the score outcomes was analyzed to determine the change in school ranking based on the budget per student, school type, and school size.

## Analysis

* How was the District summary affected?

    The district summary showed a slight changes across the below metrics. Average scores showed no significant differences removing the nineth grade class at Thomas High School. The percent of students that passed dropped approximately 01 percent for math, reading, and overall. This alligned with the 461 students removed from the 39170 total students in the district (~1.1% of the students). Scores changed by the following:

        * Average Math Score:
                    - Original: 78.99%

* How does replacing the nineth graders' math and reading scores effect Thomas High School's performace relative to other schools?

    Thomas High School (THS) remained the same ranking among the schools based on overall percent of passing students. Average math scores dropped THS from 4th to 6th. Average reading scores saw no change in school ranking. Percentage of students that passed math saw no change in school ranking. Percentage of students that passed reading saw THS drop from 1st to 3rd. 

* How does replacing the nineth grade scores effect the following:

    - Math and reading scores by grade:

        When isolating the grade scores for each high school based on math averages, THS was ranked 3rd for nineth grade, 7th for tenth grade, 5th for eleventh grade, and 4th for twelfth grade. Reading scores saw THS nineth graders ranked 5th, 1st for tenth grade, 8th for eleventh grade, and 7th for twelfth grade. The above rankings reflect the original scores before they were removed. 

    - Student spending compared to scores:

        No  change was seen when removing nineth grade scores from the overall scores.

    - School size compared to scores:

        No  change was seen when removing nineth grade scores from the overall scores.

    - School type compared to scores:

        No  change was seen when removing nineth grade scores from the overall scores.

* Score trends based on student spending, school size, and school type:

    Student Spending
    - Based on the distribution of spending per student from the highest overall passing percentages to the least, it appears that no significant trend is present.

    School Size
    - Based on the distribution of school size from the highest overall passing percentages to the least, the highest performing (>88%) schools were less than 2500 students, the worst were those greater than 2500 students.

## Conclusion

The nineth grade class at Thomas High School saw little impact in the overall performance of Thomas High School, or the District. Minor changes were seen in Thomas High School's ranking in reading and math.

The most significant results could be seen comparing school overall passing percentages with student spending, school size, and school type. Spending saw no significant correlation between overall passing and the amount. School size was negatively correlated, showing lower performance overall when student populations increased. Lastly, the school type was directly correlated with the performance. Charter schools showed high performace, while district schools showed low overall passing percentages.
